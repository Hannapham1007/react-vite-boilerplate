# Technigo Expense Tracker Project

An expense tracker built using React and Redux, where users can log their expenses and manage their financial transactions.
 
For each transaction, users can log the following details:

* Type: Selecting whether it is an income or an expense.
* Category: Choosing from predefined categories (e.g., salary, bonus, health, social life, transport, etc.).
* Amount: Entering the transaction amount.
* Note: Adding optional notes for the transaction.

Users can also edit existing transactions to make corrections or updates. They can also delete transactions that are no longer relevant. After each transaction, the application calculates and updates the user's balance.
